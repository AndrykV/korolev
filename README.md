# Korolev

Not long ago we enter to the era of Single Page Applications. Some peolpe say that we don't need server no more, and JavaScript applications can connect to DBMS directly. Fat clients. I disagree with it. This project is my approach to solve problem of modern fat web.

Warning! Korolev is not ready to use until 0.1.0 release. Now API is highly unstable.

## Usage

Add `korolev-server` to your project

```scala
libraryDependencies += "com.github.fomkin" %% "korolev-bridge" % "0.0.5-PRE"
``` 

Look for [Example.scala](https://github.com/fomkin/korolev/blob/master/example/src/main/scala/Example.scala)
